      "Summary of US Mortgage Rate Trends:\n",
      "The image provides a visual representation of the U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage trends alongside existing home sales from 2014 to 2023. Here are the key insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Mortgage Rate Trends:**\n",
      "1. **Steady Rates (2014–2020):** Mortgage rates remained relatively stable between 3% and 5% from 2014 to 2020, with minor fluctuations.\n",
      "2. **Sharp Decline (2020):** During the COVID-19 pandemic, mortgage rates dropped significantly, reaching historic lows of around 2.5% in 2020. This was likely due to Federal Reserve policies aimed at stimulating the economy.\n",
      "3. **Surge (2022–2023):** Mortgage rates began to rise sharply in 2022, peaking at over 7% in 2023. This marks the highest level in over 20 years, driven by inflation concerns and Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Existing Home Sales Trends:**\n",
      "1. **Stable Sales (2014–2020):** Existing home sales fluctuated between 4.5 million and 5.5 million annually during this period.\n",
      "2. **Spike (2020–2021):** Home sales surged to nearly 7 million in 2021, coinciding with low mortgage rates and increased demand during the pandemic.\n",
      "3. **Decline (2022–2023):** Sales dropped sharply to around 4 million in 2023, correlating with rising mortgage rates, constrained housing inventory, and affordability challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Observations:**\n",
      "- **Inverse Relationship:** There is a clear inverse relationship between mortgage rates and home sales. As mortgage rates rise, home sales tend to decline, and vice versa.\n",
      "- **Affordability Crisis (2023):** The combination of high mortgage rates, rising home prices, and limited housing inventory has led to the lowest housing affordability since 1989, as noted in the image.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Implications:**\n",
      "- **Housing Market Slowdown:** The sharp rise in mortgage rates has significantly cooled the housing market, reducing demand for existing homes.\n",
      "- **Economic Impact:** High mortgage rates may deter potential buyers, impacting the broader economy, including construction, real estate, and consumer spending.\n",
      "- **Future Trends:** If mortgage rates remain elevated, home sales may continue to struggle unless there is a significant increase in housing inventory or a decline in home prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chart highlights the critical interplay between mortgage rates and housing market activity, emphasizing the challenges faced by buyers and sellers in 2023.\n"
